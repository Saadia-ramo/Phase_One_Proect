# Data Analysis Workflow for Microsoft's Movie Industry Venture

## Overview

I have been tasked with assisting Microsoft in their venture into the movie industry. The goal is to explore what type of films are currently performing the best at the box office and provide these findings to Microsoft's new movie studio executives.

## Data Preparation

- We had 3 datasets for the project, which were provided by Microsoft we merged them into a single dataset.
- Utilized that  comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Data Cleaning

- Checked for missing or erroneous data points.
- Standardized and cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy in subsequent analyses.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Employed descriptive statistics to gain insights into the dataset.
- Utilized visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand the distribution of key variables.

## Crew Recommendations

- **Genre-Specific Crew Recommendations:**
   - *Animated Musical Movies:* Hire crew members with expertise in animation, musical composition, and voice acting. Animators, music composers, and skilled voice actors contribute significantly to the success of animated musicals.
   - *Superhero Movies:* Emphasize recruiting crew members with experience in creating visually stunning and action-packed scenes. Special effects experts, stunt coordinators, and directors experienced in the superhero genre can enhance the quality of these films.

- **Investment in Animated and Live Action Productions:**
   - Given the high performance of both animated and live-action movies in both domestic and international box offices, it is recommended that Microsoft invest more in crew members skilled in these production methods.
   - This could involve hiring or collaborating with directors, producers, writers, and technical staff who have proven success in delivering successful animated and live-action projects.

- **Correlation between Production Budget and Movie Success:**
   - The observed direct correlation between the production budget and the success of movies in both domestic and international box offices indicates that investing in a higher production budget tends to lead to better box office performance.
   - Microsoft should consider allocating appropriate budgets for their movies, especially for high-profile projects, to ensure high production values, top-notch talent, and effective marketing campaigns, ultimately contributing to better box office results.

- **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Microsoft should strategically allocate resources based on the genre and production method. For example, if they are producing an animated musical or a superhero movie, they should allocate resources accordingly to ensure the inclusion of key talents that cater to the specific requirements of those genres.

- **Continuous Analysis and Adaptation:**
   - The film industry is dynamic, and audience preferences can change. Microsoft should continuously analyze industry trends, monitor audience feedback, and adapt their strategies accordingly to stay competitive and produce content that resonates with the audience.

By implementing these recommendations and staying attuned to industry trends, Microsoft can position itself for success in the highly competitive and dynamic film industry.
